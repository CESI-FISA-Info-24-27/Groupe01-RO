class Graph:
    """
    Graph class represents a weighted undirected graph and provides methods to manipulate and visualize it.
    Attributes:
        adjacency_list (defaultdict): A dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of tuples representing 
            neighbors and their respective edge weights.
        tsp_paths (dict): A dictionary to store Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) paths for different vehicles.
    Methods:
        __init__():
            Initializes an empty graph with an adjacency list and a dictionary for TSP paths.
        add_edge(u, v, weight):
            Adds an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` with the specified `weight`.
        get_edge_weight(u, v):
            Retrieves the weight of the edge between nodes `u` and `v`. Returns 0 if no edge exists.
        get_neighbors(u):
            Returns a list of neighbors and their respective edge weights for the given node `u`.
        set_tsp_path(vehicle_id, path):
            Stores the TSP path for a specific vehicle identified by `vehicle_id`.
        get_tsp_path(vehicle_id):
            Retrieves the TSP path for the specified `vehicle_id`. Returns an empty list if no path is found.
        get_all_tsp_paths():
            Returns all stored TSP paths as a dictionary.
        draw_graph():
            Visualizes the graph using NetworkX and Matplotlib. Nodes are displayed with labels, and edges are labeled 
            with their weights.

        Draws the graph represented by the adjacency list of the current object.
        This method uses the NetworkX library to create a visual representation of the graph.
        Each node and edge is displayed, with edges labeled by their weights.
        The graph is laid out using the spring layout algorithm, which positions nodes
        to minimize edge crossings and create a visually appealing structure.
        Steps:
        - Creates a NetworkX graph from the adjacency list.
        - Adds edges with weights to the graph.
        - Computes positions for nodes using the spring layout.
        - Draws the graph with labeled nodes and edges.
        - Displays the graph using Matplotlib.
        Note:
            - The adjacency list should be a dictionary where keys are nodes and values
              are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).
            - Requires the `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries.
        Example:
            adjacency_list = {
                'A': [('B', 3), ('C', 1)],
                'B': [('A', 3), ('C', 7)],
